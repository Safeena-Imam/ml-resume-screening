# ml-resume-screening
resume-scan
This is my machine learning project for resume screening.
All the details are explained in the attached report in this repository and a Dataset.csv is uploaded.

Whatâ€™s included:
ML Zip file: A Jupyter Notebook file for the backend (ML model and data processing)
A VS Code project folder containing a simple frontend I created
Note: The frontend is basic because I had other projects pending. Feel free to improve it!
